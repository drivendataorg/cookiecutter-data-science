# General Programming

## Code Structure

- Avoid conditional branching like the plague, instead use return and break liberally, creating helper functions as needed
- Avoid nesting wherever possible. The best code is typically only one nest of functions, and MAX two levels of nesting for loops if necessary

## Error Handling

- Use explicit error handling instead of silent failures
- Validate inputs early to fail fast
- Provide helpful error messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it
- Use appropriate exception types rather than generic exceptions
- For exploratory code, opt for simpler functions over robust error handling.

## Performance

- Optimize for readability first, then performance if needed
- Cache expensive operations when appropriate

## Documentation

- Document "why" more than "what" (code should be self-explanatory)
- Add comments for complex algorithms or non-obvious design decisions
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes
- Update documentation when changing code

## Testing

- Write tests before or alongside code
- Test edge cases and failure scenarios
- Aim for high test coverage on critical paths
- Make tests deterministic and independent
