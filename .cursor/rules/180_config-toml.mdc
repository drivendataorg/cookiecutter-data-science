# TOML

## Why TOML?

TOML is a modern and minimal sytnax configuration language. Whenever possible, configuration files should use this language above JSON or YAML.

## Using TOML

The full spec is defined [here](mdc:https:/toml.io/en/v1.0.0), but it's easiest to understand TOML by seeing how it maps to JSON structures. Unlike JSON or YAML, there are multiple ways to write the same file:

### Basic Mapping: JSON to TOML

```json
{
  "title": "TOML Example",
  "database": {
    "server": "192.168.1.1",
    "ports": [8001, 8002, 8003],
    "connection_max": 5000
  },
  "servers": [
    {"name": "alpha", "role": "frontend"},
    {"name": "beta", "role": "backend"}
  ]
}
```

```toml
# TOML equivalent
title = "TOML Example"

# Tables are like JSON objects
[database]
server = "192.168.1.1"
ports = [8001, 8002, 8003]
connection_max = 5000

# Arrays of tables for nested arrays of objects
[[servers]]
name = "alpha"
role = "frontend"

[[servers]]
name = "beta"
role = "backend"
```

Alternatively:

```toml
# Alternative TOML for the same JSON structure - less recommended but valid
title = "TOML Example"

# Using dotted keys instead of table headers
database.server = "192.168.1.1" 
database.ports = [8001, 8002, 8003]
database.connection_max = 5000

# Using inline tables in array instead of [[servers]]
servers = [
  {name = "alpha", role = "frontend"},
  {name = "beta", role = "backend"}
]
```

Notes:

- Keys cannot be defined more than once.
- Quotations can be added freely to keys or values, but unless there are reserved characters (spaces, dots, etc.) in them, they are not necessary
- Once you insert a table header (ex: `[database]`, everything beneath it will be under that table until you add a new header)
