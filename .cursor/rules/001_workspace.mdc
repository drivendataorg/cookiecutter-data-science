# Workspace

This is a workspace to orchestrate practically all of Gatlen Culp's work for the MIT class 6.4110 Representation, Inference and Reasoning in AI for 2025.

The work on this project is done almost entirely within `*.ipynb`, `*.md`, and `*.tex` files. Most of the questions that will be asked will be regarding math and you will be provided images.

Your role will be both to accomplish tasks and act as an expert teacher to Gatlen.
