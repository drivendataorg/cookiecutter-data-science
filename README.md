GOTem is forked from (and synced with) [CookieCutter Data Science (CCDS) V2](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/), one of the most popular, flexible, and well maintained Python templates out there. GOTem extends CCDS with carefully selected defaults, dependency stack, customizations, additional features (that I maybe should have spent time contributing to the original project), and contemporary best practices. Ready for not just data science but also general Python development, research projects, and academic work.

### Key Features

- **🚀 Modern Tooling & Living Template** – Start with built-in support for UV, Ruff, FastAPI, Pydantic, Typer, Loguru, and Polars so you can tackle cutting-edge Python immediately. Template updates as environment changes.
- **🙌 Instant Git & CI/CD** – Enjoy automatic repo creation, branch protections, and preconfigured GitHub Actions that streamline your workflow from day one.
- **🤝 Small-Scale to Scalable** – Ideal for solo projects or small teams, yet robust enough to expand right along with your growth.
- **🏃‍♂️ Start Fast, Stay Strong** – Encourages consistent structure, high-quality code, and minimal friction throughout your project's entire lifecycle.
- **🌐 Full-Stack + Rare Boilerplates** – Covers standard DevOps, IDE configs, and publishing steps, plus extra setups for LaTeX assignments, web apps, CLI tools, and more—perfect for anyone seeking a "one-stop" solution.

### Who is this for?

**CCDS** is white bread: simple, familiar, unoffensive, and waiting for your choice of toppings. **GOTem** is the expert-crafted and opinionated "everything burger," fully loaded from the start for any task you want to do (so long as you want to do it in a specific way). Some of the selections might be an acquired taste and users are encouraged to leave them off as they start and perhaps not all will appreciate my tastes even with time, but it is the setup I find *_delicious_*.

If the right-hand column describes you better, [CookieCutter Data Science (CCDS)](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/) or another minimal template might be a better fit.

<!-- _I'm looking for a way to use [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/) over [CookieCutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/) + CCDS, but for now, CCDS needs to be used due to their custom configuration_ -->

<!-- It is recommended to use [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/) instead of [CookieCutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/). The resulting project is the same, but with the added option of being able to sync your project with the original template if this repository updates as if it were an incomming commit.

Clone using Cruft
```bash
    cruft create https://github.com/GatlenCulp/gatlens-opinionated-template
``` -->

<!--
This project is more of a hobby and research project more than it is a practical template. Gatlen really enjoys the occasional research on the tooling ecosystem and understanding which tools solve what problems and how. He tends to have a very prefectionist perspective on projects beyond what is practical. Many of the packages included in this project, Gatlen has not yet used, but rather examined and compared against other tools and determined to be something to leverage once the need arises. The selection of packages and tools are in a way, a reminder of what resources he has have determined in advance to likely be helpful.

Here are a few guiding principles of this template to determine whether or not you should use it:
1. **Modern and Supported over Ubiquitous** -- Many of the packages and tools I have chosen for this package are NOT the defaults. (Another possible name for this template was "Everything but Defaults"). Unless I deem a built-in library to be the best of its type, it is likely unused. Instead of Logging I used Loguru. Instead of MatPlotLib I use Plotly. Instead of json I used orjson. Instead of pip I used UV. Instead of Django or Flask I used FastAPI. Instead of Argparse I use Typer.  Instead of Time, I use Arrow. Instead of Pandas I use Polars. It's not that these packages aren't used, they are extremely popular and indeed tend to offer better speed and functionality than the "defaults." Perhaps this is simply a selection of trendy packages that add unnecessary bloat and learning curves. But I think these packages can be a helpful learning experience that help me and others leverage the power this new rust-powered python ecosystem of tools that will become increasingly popular with time. Yes, these might not have as much developer documentation or extensions built up around it, but I think they important nonetheless and the novelty is also a plus in the sense that a lot of baggage and backwards-compatability that comes with an established package is not there. There aren't a lot of shitty tutorials from 15 years ago and a bloated API. Instead there is a very clear cut API with great defaults. Often times these packages work just with the sam syntax as the old greats do.
2. **Aspirational over Practical** --...
3. **Simplicity** -- I tend to pick packages that offer a lot of power with very simple and non-intrusive syntax. As an example, Django is a popular web framework that is very opinionated and requires a particular project structure and syntax to play nicely. Indeed, much of what it does is batteries-included best practice with tons of extensions made by the community, but it is also a very heavy library and once you start with a Django project, it is very hard to switch. I try to make it as easy as possible to switch in and out whatever you want to use.
4. **Good Defaults** -- To me, it's important to have good defaults on the packages I have set up so I can just import them and know I'm getting the best experience out of the box. A lot of this is the reason why I choose these modern packages -- because instead of having to bend over backwards to make things backwards compatible, the package can get a hard restart with decades of learning what the established greats did. I think about it this way: If The reset button were to be hit right now on the what tools and packages people used in Python, what do I wish they did?
5. **Customizability** -- I love customizing my tools and opt for tools where I can do a lot of customization and fiddling.
6. **Small Teams / Individual** -- As someone who personally tends to work by myself or with a few people on research projects, I gear this template towards iterating quickly and with high quality. If a tool requires such deep knowledge that someone has to spend a day researching it just to use, I don't want it.
7. **Scalable** -- As noted above, this is mainly geared to individuals and small teams. However, in the case you want to scale production or team size or even if you move to a new and larger organization, I want those skills to transfer and for there to be little more to learn and so that you don't have to learn an entirely new skillset or library. -->

If you plan major changes, consider upstreaming them to [CookieCutter Data Science (CCDS)](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science). For minor fixes or adjustments to GOTem, submit an issue or pull request here. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

### Known Issues

[Some users have experienced an issue with Git LFS being improperly configured](https://github.com/GatlenCulp/gatlens-opinionated-template/pull/11#issuecomment-2633076431). I'm currently working to get this resolved. It's reported that the following may fix the problem:

1. Clone the package manually `git clone <this-repo>`
1. Set up git lfs, skipping smudge `git lfs install --skip-smudge` as suggested [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41716509/fail-to-clone-repository-with-git-lfs)
1. Install the package with `pip install .`
