# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

**Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS)** is a tool for setting up a data science project template that incorporates best practices. To learn more about CCDS's philosophy, visit the [project homepage](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/).

> ℹ️ Cookiecutter Data Science v2 has changed from v1. It now requires installing the new cookiecutter-data-science Python package, which extends the functionality of the [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html) templating utility. Use the provided `ccds` command-line program instead of `cookiecutter`.

## Installation

Cookiecutter Data Science v2 requires Python 3.8+. Since this is a cross-project utility application, we recommend installing it with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). Installation command options:

```bash
# With pipx from PyPI (recommended)
pipx install cookiecutter-data-science

# With pip from PyPI
pip install cookiecutter-data-science

# With conda from conda-forge (coming soon)
# conda install cookiecutter-data-science -c conda-forge
```

## Starting a new project

To start a new project, run:

```bash
ccds
```

### The resulting directory structure

The directory structure of your new project will look something like this (depending on the settings that you choose):

```
├── LICENSE            <- Open-source license if one is chosen
├── Makefile           <- Makefile with convenience commands like `make data` or `make train`
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
├── data
│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.

│
├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
│                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
│                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
│
├── pyproject.toml     <- Project configuration file with package metadata for 
│                         {{ cookiecutter.module_name }} and configuration for tools like black
│

│
├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
│                         generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
│
├── setup.cfg          <- Configuration file for flake8
│
└── {{ cookiecutter.module_name }}   <- Source code for use in this project.
    │

    │
    └── plots.py                <- Code to create visualizations   
```

## Using unreleased changes

By default, `ccds` will download the most recently _released_ version of the template. If there are any _unreleased_ changes to the template (or changes in a separate branch) that you want to incorporate, you can do so by checking out whatever branch you'd like to use (checkout `master` for the latest changes):

```bash
ccds -c master
```

## Using v1

If you want to use the old v1 project template, you need to have either the cookiecutter-data-science package or cookiecutter package installed. Then, use either command-line program with the `-c v1` option:

```bash
ccds https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science -c v1
# or equivalently
cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science -c v1
```
