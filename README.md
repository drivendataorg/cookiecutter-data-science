# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

This template is based on [Project homepage](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/), but adds couple of
convenience functions:
- package management with poetry
- pre-commit hooks to facilitate code quality
- auto setup


### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/contentful/cookiecutter-data-science

### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:
