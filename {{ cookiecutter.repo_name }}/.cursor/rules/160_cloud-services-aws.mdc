# Cloud Services - AWS

## 01 Platform Selection

- AWS is the primary cloud platform for deployments
- Design solutions to be platform-agnostic when feasible
- Document any AWS-specific dependencies that would affect migration

## 02 Infrastructure Management

- 02.01 Terraform

  - Use Terraform for infrastructure-as-code (preferred)
  - Organize modules logically with clear separation of concerns
  - Store state files securely in remote backend
  - Use variables and locals to improve reusability

- 02.02 Configuration Management

  - Use Ansible for configuration management
  - Avoid AWS-specific tools like CloudFormation when possible
  - Document deployment steps thoroughly

## 03 Containerization

- 03.01 Docker

  - Implement multi-stage builds for smaller images
  - Use specific version tags instead of 'latest'
  - Include health checks in container definitions
  - Follow principle of one service per container

- 03.02 Orchestration

  - Prefer Kubernetes over ECS when appropriate
  - Use Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments
  - Document all environment variables and volume mounts

## 04 Security

- 04.01 Authentication

  - Use IAM roles with least privilege principle
  - Implement MFA for human access
  - Rotate access keys regularly

- 04.02 Data Protection

  - Encrypt data at rest and in transit
  - Implement proper backup strategies
  - Use secret management solutions (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)

## 05 Cost Management

- 05.01 Resource Optimization

  - Implement auto-scaling based on actual usage
  - Schedule non-production resources to shut down during off-hours
  - Use spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads

- 05.02 Monitoring

  - Set up billing alerts and budgets
  - Tag resources appropriately for cost allocation
  - Review unused resources monthly

## 06 Networking

- 06.01 Architecture

  - Implement proper VPC design with public/private subnets
  - Use Transit Gateway for complex networking requirements
  - Implement proper security groups and NACLs

- 06.02 Connectivity

  - Configure proper DNS resolution
  - Document IP address allocations
  - Use service discovery when appropriate
