# Functional vs Object Oriented Programming

## Functional Programming Principles

- Don't mutate arguments
  - If mutation is necessary for performance, add `mutate: bool = False` parameter
- Avoid side effects
- Ensure deterministic behavior
  - Pass RNG as parameter if needed (default RNGs should be seeded)
- Use default parameters when applicable

## Object-Oriented Principles

- Methods may mutate their instance
- AVOID INHERITANCE
  - Instead of inheriting, create instances of other classes
- Use classes for modeling data that needs mutation
- Follow SOLID principles
