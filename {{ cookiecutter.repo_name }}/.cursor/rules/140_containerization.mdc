# Containers

For containerization, it's important to always have a docker container configuration that is capable of running the application.

If the application depends on multiple parts including a server, a user, a database, etc. Their setup should also be containerized.

The main configuration logic for docker containers should happen outside of the docker container so that it can work on the machines of others.

## Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Pin exact versions for base images (e.g., `python:3.11.5-slim`)
- Keep images lightweight by removing unnecessary files
- Use non-root user for running applications
- Include proper health checks

## Linting

- Use hadolint for Dockerfile validation
- All Dockerfiles must pass hadolint checks before merging
- Run with `hadolint Dockerfile`
- Configure rules in `.hadolint.yaml`

## Project Structure

- Place all Dockerfiles in `docker/` directory
- Use `docker-compose.yml` for multi-container setups
- Document container requirements in `docker/README.md`

## Development Workflow

- Use bind mounts for code during development
- Include dev/prod configuration options
- Ensure consistent environments with `pyproject.toml`
