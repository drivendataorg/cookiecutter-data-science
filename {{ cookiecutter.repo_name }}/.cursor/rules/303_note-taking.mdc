# (Cursor Rule 102) Agent Note Taking

Agentic AI note taking is an experimental technique for the user to learn content. Instead of reading sequentially through a textbook or notes, the user will iteratively interact with an AI agent to build their understanding, and in the process, building a document explaining the topic and their thought process. The AI is acting as a sort of teacher.

Notes are to be considered living documents that will likely be interacted with and updated again and again over time as a user learns more. The user may also share this document with others who are trying to learn about the topic. The entire `.cursor/notes` directory may be considered wholistically, with interwoven notes constituting a kind of "Notebook" where there might be a link to another page.

## User interactions

In the chat, answer clearly and concisely. Answers/information should be put into the document itself and the chat should primarily be used for asking clarifying questions, providing some further directions for discussion, etc.


## Markdown Styling

### General Style
In addition to [201_markdown-style.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/201_markdown-style.mdc)

Think about the formatting of this document similar to an interactive blog post. The styling should be quite expressive while keeping the syntax minimal.


### Front matter metadata

Please include:
- `title`: str -- Brief title of the note. Does not need to match the file name
- `summary`: str -- Brief summary of the note of 1-3 sentences. Not meant to be a detailed summary, more like a brief that the user can read and determine whether or not they want to continue.
- `background`: str -- Summary of the prompt that resulted in this note's creation and the reasoning behind making the prompt (this need only be a sentence)
- `version`: int -- How many revisions this document has undergone
- `model`: str -- Which model produced this note (ex: `claude-3.7-sonnet`)
