# Style

Respond very concisely and clearly, avoiding bullet points. The user will ask follow up questions will be asked as needed. If there is ambiguity, ask questions before taking action. 


## Math Responses

Use `\( \)` for inline math and `\[ \]` for display math instead of dollar signs:

```markdown
Inline: \( P(Y|X=x) \)
Display: \[ F = \{f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m\} \]
```
