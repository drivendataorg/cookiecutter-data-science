# CI/CD Github Actions

For any CI/CD tasks, please implement them into `.github/workflows` directory for GitHub Actions.

## 01 Workflow Structure

- Name workflows descriptively: `name: Python Tests`
- Use appropriate triggers:
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]
    pull_request:
      branches: [main]
  ```
- Organize jobs logically with clear names
- Use consistent job dependencies with `needs:`

## 02 Best Practices

- Use GitHub-hosted runners when possible: `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- Pin action versions with full SHA for security: `actions/checkout@8e5e7e5ab8b370d6c329ec480221332ada57f0ab`
- Leverage organization secrets for sensitive data
- Set appropriate timeouts: `timeout-minutes: 10`
- Use GitHub Cache for dependencies:
  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: ~/.cache/pip
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
  ```

## 03 Testing Locally with Act CLI

Act CLI allows testing GitHub Actions workflows locally:

```bash
# Run all workflows
act

# Run specific workflow
act -W .github/workflows/python-tests.yml

# Run specific job
act -j test -W .github/workflows/python-tests.yml

# Run with specific event
act pull_request -W .github/workflows/python-tests.yml
```

Common Act CLI flags:

- `-P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest` - Use specific platform image
- `--secret-file .secrets` - Provide secrets from file
- `-v` - Verbose output
