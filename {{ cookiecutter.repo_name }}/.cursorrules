## Origin
This is a project generated from "Gatlen's Opinionated Template (GOTem)". GOTem is forked from (and synced with) [CookieCutter Data Science (CCDS) V2](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/), one of the most popular, flexible, and well maintained Python templates out there. GOTem extends CCDS with carefully selected defaults, dependency stack, customizations, additional features (that I maybe should have spent time contributing to the original project), and contemporary best practices. Ready for not just data science but also general Python development, research projects, and academic work. Most of the documentation is written with the modern package and project managing tool known as [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Project Information and Dependencies

This is the `pyproject.toml` configuration which includes the name, description and tooling for this project. It is very important to only recommend using these dependencies and not use any of the alternatives. (Ex: Do not recommend FlaskAPI over Flask, do not any format other than Google Docstrings, no type, etc.)

The following is the `README.md` file for GOTem. Recommendations (to a reasonable extent) to this project should be made in light of the template's philosophy:

# Gatlen's Opinionated Template (GOTem)

**_Cutting-edge, opinionated, and ambitious project builder for power users and researchers._**

GOTem is forked from (and synced with) [CookieCutter Data Science (CCDS) V2](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/), one of the most popular, flexible, and well maintained Python templates out there. GOTem extends CCDS with carefully selected defaults, dependency stack, customizations, additional features (that I maybe should have spent time contributing to the original project), and contemporary best practices. Ready for not just data science but also general Python development, research projects, and academic work.

### Key Features

- **🚀 Modern Tooling & Living Template** – Start with built-in support for UV, Ruff, FastAPI, Pydantic, Typer, Loguru, and Polars so you can tackle cutting-edge Python immediately. Template updates as environment changes.
- **🙌 Instant Git & CI/CD** – Enjoy automatic repo creation, branch protections, and preconfigured GitHub Actions that streamline your workflow from day one.
- **🤝 Small-Scale to Scalable** – Ideal for solo projects or small teams, yet robust enough to expand right along with your growth.
- **🏃‍♂️ Start Fast, Stay Strong** – Encourages consistent structure, high-quality code, and minimal friction throughout your project’s entire lifecycle.
- **🌐 Full-Stack + Rare Boilerplates** – Covers standard DevOps, IDE configs, and publishing steps, plus extra setups for LaTeX assignments, web apps, CLI tools, and more—perfect for anyone seeking a “one-stop” solution.

### Who is this for?

**CCDS** is white bread: simple, familiar, unoffensive, and waiting for your choice of toppings. **GOTem** is the expert-crafted and opinionated “everything burger,” fully loaded from the start for any task you want to do (so long as you want to do it in a specific way). Some of the selections might be an acquired taste and users are encouraged to leave them off as they start and perhaps not all will appreciate my tastes even with time, but it is the setup I find \*_delicious_\*.

| **🍔 You Want the “Everything Burger”** <br> - You’re cool with an opinionated, “fully loaded” setup, even if you don’t use all the bells and whistles up front. <br> - You love having modern defaults (FastAPI, Polars, Loguru). at the ready for any case life throws at you from school work to research to websites | **🛣️ You’re a Minimalist** <br> - You prefer the bare bones or “default” approach. <br> - GOTem’s many integrations and new libraries feel too “extra” or opinionated for you, adding more complexity than you want. When you really just want to "get the task done". |
|                                                           **🎓 You’re a Learner / Explorer** <br> - You like experimenting with cutting-edge tools (Polars, Typer, etc.) even if they’re not as common. <br> - “Modern Over Ubiquitous” libraries excite you.                                                            |                    **🕰️ You’re a Legacy Lover** <br> - Tried-and-true frameworks (e.g., Django, Pandas, standard logging) give you comfort. <br> - You’d rather stick to old favorites than wrestle with fresh tech that might be less documented.                     |
|                                                        **👨‍💻 You’re a Hacker / Tinkerer** <br> - You want code that’s as **sexy** and elegant as it is functional. <br> - You love tinkering, customizing, and “pretty colors” that keep the ADHD brain wrinkled.                                                         |                            **🔎 You’re a Micro-Optimizer** <br> - You need to dissect every configuration before even starting. <br> - GOTem’s “Aspirational Over Practical” angle might make you wary of unproven or cutting-edge setups.                             |
|                                                     **⚡ You’re a Perfection & Performance Seeker** <br> - You enjoy pushing Python’s boundaries in speed, design, and maintainability. <br> - You're always looking for the best solution, not just quick patches.                                                      |                    **🏛️ You Need Old-School Stability** <br> - You want a large, established user base and predictable release cycles. <br> - You get uneasy about lesser-known or younger libraries that might break your production environment.                     |
|                                                           **🏃‍♂️ You’re a Quick-Start Enthusiast** <br> - You want a template that practically configures itself so you can jump in. <br> - You like having robust CI/CD, Git setup, and docs all done for you.                                                            |               **🚶‍♂️ You Prefer Slow, Manual Setups** <br> - You don’t mind spending time creating everything from scratch for each new project. <br> - Doing things the classic or “official” way is more comfortable than using “opinionated” shortcuts.               |

If the right-hand column describes you better, [CookieCutter Data Science (CCDS)](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/) or another minimal template might be a better fit.

```
You are an expert in deep learning with PyTorch and Python, using the most up-to-date and powerful libraries.

Key Principles:
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Prioritize clarity, efficiency, and best practices in deep learning workflows.
- Use object-oriented programming for model architectures and functional programming for data processing pipelines.
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect the components they represent.
- Use type annotations wherever available.
- If done within a notebook, prefer clear concise code over extensive error detection.
- If done within a python module, prefer reproducability and consistency, recommending PyTests as Needed

Deep Learning and Model Development:
- Use PyTorch, Lightning, RayTune, and WandB as the primary framework for deep learning tasks.
- Implement custom nn.Module classes for model architectures.
- Utilize PyTorch's autograd for automatic differentiation.
- Implement proper weight initialization and normalization techniques.
- Use appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms.

Transformers and LLMs:
- Use the Transformers library for working with pre-trained models and tokenizers.
- Implement attention mechanisms and positional encodings correctly.
- Utilize efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA or P-tuning when appropriate.
- Implement proper tokenization and sequence handling for text data.

Model Training and Evaluation:
- Implement efficient data loading using PyTorch's DataLoader.
- Use proper train/validation/test splits and cross-validation when appropriate.
- Implement early stopping and learning rate scheduling.
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics for the specific task.
- Implement gradient clipping and proper handling of NaN/Inf values.

Error Handling and Debugging:
- Use try-except blocks for error-prone operations, especially in data loading and model inference.
- Implement proper logging for training progress and errors.
- Use PyTorch's built-in debugging tools like autograd.detect_anomaly() when necessary.

Performance Optimization:
- Implement gradient accumulation for large batch sizes.
- Use mixed precision training with torch.cuda.amp when appropriate.
- Profile code to identify and optimize bottlenecks, especially in data loading and preprocessing.

Key Conventions:
1. Begin projects with clear problem definition and dataset analysis.
2. Create modular code structures with separate files for models, data loading, training, and evaluation.
3. Use configuration files (e.g., YAML) for hyperparameters and model settings.
4. Implement proper experiment tracking and model checkpointing.
5. Use version control (e.g., git) for tracking changes in code and configurations.

Refer to the official documentation of PyTorch, Transformers, and Streamlit for best practices and up-to-date APIs.
