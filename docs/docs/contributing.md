# Contributing

The Cookiecutter Data Science project is opinionated, but not afraid to be wrong. Best practices change, tools evolve, and lessons are learned. **The goal of this project is to make it easier to start, structure, and share an analysis.** [Pull requests](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science/pulls) and [filing issues](https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science/issues) is encouraged. We'd love to hear what works for you, and what doesn't.
