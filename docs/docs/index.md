!!! info "CCDS V2 Announcement"

    Version 2 of Cookiecutter Data Science has launched recently. To learn more about what's different and what's in progress, see the [announcement blog post for more information](https://drivendata.co/blog/ccds-v2).


## Quickstart

Cookiecutter Data Science v2 requires Python 3.9+. Since this is a cross-project utility application, we recommend installing it with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). Installation command options:

=== "With pipx (recommended)"

    ```bash
    pipx install cookiecutter-data-science

    # From the parent directory where you want your project
    ccds
    ```

=== "With pip"

    ```bash
    pip install cookiecutter-data-science
    `
    # From the parent directory where you want your project
    ccds
    ```

=== "With conda (coming soon!)"

    ```bash
    # conda install cookiecutter-data-science -c conda-forge

    # From the parent directory where you want your project
    # ccds
    ```

=== "Use the v1 template"

    ```bash
    pip install cookiecutter

    # From the parent directory where you want your project
    cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science -c v1
    ```

!!! info "Use the ccds command-line tool"

    Cookiecutter Data Science v2 now requires installing the new `cookiecutter-data-science` Python package, which extends the functionality of the [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html) templating utility. Use the provided `ccds` command-line program instead of `cookiecutter`.


## Starting a new project

Starting a new project is as easy as running this command at the command line. No need to create a directory first, the cookiecutter will do it for you.

```bash
ccds
```

The `ccds` commandline tool defaults to the Cookiecutter Data Science template, but you can pass your own template as the first argument if you want.


## Example

<!-- TERMYNAL OUTPUT -->


Now that you've got your project, you're ready to go! You should do the following:

 - **Check out the directory structure** below so you know what's in the project and how to use it.
 - **Read the [opinions](opinions.md)** that are baked into the project so you understand best practices and the philosophy behind the project structure.
 - **Read the [using the template](using-the-template.md) guide** to understand how to get started on a project that uses the template.


 Enjoy!


## Directory structure

The directory structure of your new project will look something like this (depending on the settings that you choose):
